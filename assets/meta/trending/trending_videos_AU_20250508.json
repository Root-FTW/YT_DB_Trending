Registered with the Information Commissioner's Office; registration number ZA059156. You can find our terms of use, privacy policy and our cookie policy here. Claimsline Group Ltd is a claims management company. Any solicitor we recommend you to is an independent professional from whom you will receive impartial and confidential advice. You are free to choose another solicitor. Claimsline Group Ltd is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in respect of regulated claims management activities FRN Number is 831196. ***Free Agreement Check refers only to the live soft-credit check completed online to identify your car finance agreements. *Where No Win, No Fee is offered - You pay nothing unless your claim is successful. A fee between 18 - 36% incl Vat applies on successful claims (fee dependant on level of redress secured), and a cancellation fee may apply outside the 14 day cooling-off period. You do not need to use a claims management company to make a claim; you can do this yourself for free by contacting the car dealership or finance provider and if that is not successful you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service. We may receive a fee for introducing you to a third party/panel solicitor, this does not affect any compensation you may receive. Where past redress is mentioned Christopher and Joanne Doran were awarded all sales commission they paid plus interest (76% of their premium) through legal action. This differed from the standard FCA guidelines that typically only allowed consumers to reclaim commission in excess of 50% of the premium. However, this represents a single case rather than a systematic comparison of outcomes",

Claimsline Group Ltd is a claims management company. Any solicitor we recommend you to is an independent professional from whom you will receive impartial and confidential advice. You are free to choose another solicitor. Claimsline Group Ltd is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in respect of regulated claims management activities FRN Number is 831196. ***Free Agreement Check refers only to the live soft-credit check completed online to identify your car finance agreements. *Where No Win, No Fee is offered - You pay nothing unless your claim is successful. A fee between 18 - 36% incl Vat applies on successful claims (fee dependant on level of redress secured), and a cancellation fee may apply outside the 14 day cooling-off period. You do not need to use a claims management company to make a claim; you can do this yourself for free by contacting the car dealership or finance provider and if that is not successful you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service. We may receive a fee for introducing you to a third party/panel solicitor, this does not affect any compensation you may receive. Where past redress is mentioned Christopher and Joanne Doran were awarded all sales commission they paid plus interest (76% of their premium) through legal action. This differed from the standard FCA guidelines that typically only allowed consumers to reclaim commission in excess of 50% of the premium. However, this represents a single case rather than a systematic comparison of outcomes"

                "description": "How To Train Your Dragon - In Theaters June 13\n\nFrom three-time Oscar\u00ae nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation\u2019s acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. \n\nOn the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. \n\nWith the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village\u2019s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. \n\nAs an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup\u2019s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. \n\nThe film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones).\nHow to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois. It is also produced by three-time Oscar\u00ae nominee Marc Platt (Wicked, La La Land) and Emmy winner Adam Siegel (Drive, 2 Guns). How To Train Your Dragon is part of the Filmed For IMAX\u00ae Program, which offers filmmakers IMAX\u00ae technology to help them deliver the most immersive movie experience to audiences around the world. \n\nInspired by Cressida Cowell\u2019s New York Times bestselling book series, DreamWorks Animation\u2019s How to Train Your Dragon franchise has captivated global audiences, earning four Academy Award\u00ae nominations and grossing more than $1.6 billion at the global box-office. Now, through cutting-edge visual effects, DeBlois transforms his beloved animated saga into a breathtaking live-action spectacle, bringing the epic adventures of Hiccup and Toothless to life with jaw-dropping realism as they discover the true meaning of friendship, courage and destiny. \n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HowToTrainYourDragon \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/httydragon\nX: https://x.com/httydragon\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@httydragon \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures \nWebsite: https://www.howtotrainyourdragon.com/\nhttps://www.welcometoberk.com/\n#HowToTrainYourDragon",
