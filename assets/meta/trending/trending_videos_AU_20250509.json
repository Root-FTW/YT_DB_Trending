However, instead of it being Sandiction, Carvs, Wunba, Kolanii, Mumbo Jumbo or Grian, it's actually just Luchino! I like to make Giant Mega Builds, collect illegal stuff and break the game, this is similar to a custom Minecraft Challenge video, except the custom Minecraft Challenge is to survive. You could call this Minecraft, but hardcore.\n\n\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\n\n\u2665 Like.\n\u2663 Comment.\n\u2660 Subscribe!\n\nCurrent Sub Count: 144,387\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY-jqRwUhWnRQ5wDp-J1BGQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796 \n\nBusiness Inquiries: SponsorLuchino@gmail.com\n\n\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796 \n\nThanks for watching :))\n\nI built the World's Biggest Zoo for REAL animals in survival minecraft!\n\n#minecrafthardcore #hardcoreminecraft #minecraft"
